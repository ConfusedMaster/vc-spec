# Vietcong data-files specification

This project aims to document as many file formats used by Vietcong game as possible.
We use mainly Python scripts and
[Veles](https://github.com/codilime/veles)
for documenting each file format (there is no official specification and also no disassembling is used during this process).

Python scripts are stored in *scripts* directory.
There is mostly one script per file format.
They are used for verifying that our specification (stored in *doc* dir) is compatible with files distributed by Vietcong game or generated by official utils (such as game editor or 3DS Max plugins).
Sometimes they have more functionality, type -h for help.

We also
[forked](https://github.com/OpenVietcong/veles)
Veles binary analysis tool for better understanding of each file format (it helps us understand meaning of each byte of file by aplying certain parsers).

Specification of CBF file format is partly based on
[vietcong-unpacker](https://github.com/Romop5/vietcong-unpacker)
project.
